"""
Some general and probably very, very slow code for computing L-series
of elliptic curves over general number fields.

NOTE: This code could probably get moved into Sage at some point,
though it's not at all clear the API below is the best.  For example,
instead of storing keys as ideals, I store them as pairs (Norm,
reduced gens), since (1) I was running into bugs where equal ideals
have different hashes and (2) this format is much easier to look at.
