LMFDB: The Modular Forms and L-Functions Database

This module contains code that supports the creation and deploying of
the lmfdb, which is hosted at http://db.modform.org.

For a talk with some overview of the original motivation and
architecture, see http://wstein.org/talks/2010-10-lmfdb/

This code assumes that there is a mongodb server that is available
by default on localhost at port 29000.
