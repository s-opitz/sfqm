"""
This module implement a class that represents the collection of
newforms.  

The code in this module defines classes both for working with the
collection of all newforms in the database, and for populating this
collection with new data about newforms.   The NewformCollection
class is instantiated by the main MFDB database object.
The classes for populating the newforms table further or in
turn instantiated by the NewformCollection object.

The newform collection has documents that contain data about newforms.
It also has a subcollection 'counts', which records the number of
newforms with given level, weight, and character.  """
