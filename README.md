Finite Quadratic Modules and Simple Lattices
============================================

Implementation of several algorithms and tools for the article 
"Lattices with many Borcherds products" 
by Jan H. Bruinier, S. Ehlen and E. Freitag.

Dependencies
============

- sage: A current version of sage 
(we tested the implementation with sage 6.1.1 and sage 6.2)

The library dependencies have been included into the release files.

The following modules are required and can also be obtained
separately from my (sehlen) psage fork (use the devel branch).

- psage.modules.finite_quadratic_module
- psage.modform.weilrep_tools
